# openMapsUIC
This is a shortest route program for UIC campus walking.
You use the program by entering two destination points, typically buildings, that are located on UIC campus.
This program then uses shortest path algorithms relative to walking distance to map the shortest route for you to take.
You use input from osm files included to make it so this shortest route program can be calculated for maps other than UIC.
